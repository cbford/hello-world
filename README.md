About me

I love playing with data because it shows you things you didn't know were there, challenges your assumptions, and usually leads to more questions than answers. And I love questions.

I also love playing guitar and ukulele and singing. I also love to knit and crochet and to learn new fiber arts. 

I see these things as being connected. Music + crafting + data analysis + programming --> creative problem solving.
